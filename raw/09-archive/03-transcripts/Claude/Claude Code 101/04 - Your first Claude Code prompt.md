# Your first Claude Code prompt

You talk to Claude Code like you would talk to any AI assistant. When entering your prompt, here are some things that you can consider that can both protect and make things easier for you. You can choose whether Claude auto accepts every file change it suggests or require it to ask you for explicit permission each time. With shift plus tab, you can cycle between both modes. In auto accept mode, it will automatically approve an edit or creation of a file, but ask your permission to run commands. There isn't a right or wrong way.

It's just whatever you feel the most comfortable with. Within this shift tab menu is the plan mode. Plan mode takes your prompt and uses read-only tools to analyze your code base and do research on your suggested implementation. It will also ask you questions on items that it wants clarification on. It then returns to you a long detailed plan that it can execute on in more detail. Plan mode works great for planning complex changes or doing a safe code review.

A lot of the time you're asking Claude to do multi-step implementations towards a feature and this is exactly what plan mode excels at. So, why don't we give it a try? I have an application here that desperately needs a dark mode toggle. So, I'm going to use Claude Code to implement this for me. So, I'm in the root directory of my project and I'm going to hit the shift tab a couple times to go into plan mode. Then, let's write out the prompt.

My app needs a dark mode implemented across the entire app. Can you create a toggle switch on the header that allows user to toggle between light mode and dark mode? I need you to find a good contrast color that works based on my existing light theme. And let's let Claude plan this out. And after reviewing, I think it looks pretty good. At the end of all this, we can see explicitly what Claude did and how it came to its conclusion.

And the dark mode is looking pretty good. Awesome. >> [music] >> When using Claude Code, try to be as descriptive as possible with your prompt. If you want to stay in the loop at every step, you can do that. Use plan mode to let Claude get a little bit more in the nitty-gritty with what you want to achieve before executing on that plan.
