# How Anthropic uses Claude in Cybersecurity

Cyber security at Anthropic I would  [music] say is I'm biased but I think   it's one of the most interesting parts of  the company. There's no [music] precedent   for what we're building and so securing it  is also kind of you know a new frontier. The thing that I've always kind of [music] been  stuck on is that we have these tools to do this   work, but a lot of them don't actually fit  [music] what the analysts or investigators,   people with boots on the ground are  doing. Before investigating a security   event would be [music] jumping between five  to six different tools, running, you know,   three to four different query languages over  different databases. For a simple investigation,   it would take a couple hours at least [music] and  a couple days at most. And that is part of why we   built Clue.

Clue is a detection and response  platform that we've built with cloud code. One thing that makes Clue so powerful is  it is connected to our internal system. So   it has access [music] via tool use to query our  data warehouses, but it also has the ability to   query like internal knowledge of our company. [music] So Slack messages and our code bases. That is usually like that missing piece [music]  that really helps alerts be contextualized for   your environment. to note this is just a  sample set of data that I've imported into   clue.

So this isn't actually anthropic internal  information. How we start in clue investigate is   the user being me would ask a question. So I say  a developer just gave themselves [music] admin   access. Is this authorized? Can you check for  credential compromise and what actions they   took afterwards? [music] And so we have asked  Claude to come up with a plan on how it would   investigate this.

[music] Comes up with these six  steps. Then it will kick up a bunch of queries. And so these are the tools that's reaching out  for more information to help us figure out what's   going on. And we see the assistant Claude has  come back and has gathered some more information. And it says, you know, this kind of looks like a  pretty classic privilege escalation. Here's some   of the reasons I'm coming to that verdict.

And it's going to issue some more queries. This is again this is sample data but it the  source IP when looked up was a Russian data center   and it was flagged as malicious by virus total  and it then actually comes to you know good news   this [music] seems to be isolated but it's also  identifying there's some gaps in our security   posture on this system so there's some afteraction  items that we could take and then finally the   final investigation summary that Claude will come  up with and share with you all the investigations   that were taken and the findings we have this  ability to go through immense amounts of data,   immense amounts of alerts [music] and then just  raise what actually a human should look at. I had   been working on our Q4 plans and I was like okay  we're going to work on this suppression engine   and this is going to take you know at least 1 to  [music] two months. One of our new hires built   it in a week. Most of it is because Claude Code is  able to explain to [music] them here's how this is   set up. Here's how it's working.

And it feels like  for me when I bring people on that I'm giving them   a tool that will [music] give them that autonomy  rather than them having to, you know, kind of like   swim in the deep end immediately. [music] I'm  building the tools that I wish that I had. And   I'm actually able to [music] do what I feel like  is pushing from being a practitioner to being a   researcher, kind of a scientist, [music] because  I'm getting to test out a lot of the ways that,   you know, I've only imagined us being able to  process, you know, this immense [music] amount   of data and have more visibility into our  systems that previously was just out of reach.
