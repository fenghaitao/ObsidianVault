# Creating a subagent

In the previous video, we covered what sub agents are and how they work. Claude Code includes built-in sub agents, but you can also create your own sub agents that specialize in certain tasks. Custom sub agents are markdown files with YAML front matter. These markdown files contain configuration that helps Claude understand when to use a sub agent and provides directions to the sub agent itself. Now, the easiest way to create a sub agent is with the /agents command. This panel is the main interface for managing your sub agents.

Once here, select create new agent. You'll then be asked if you want to create a sub agent for the current project or a sub agent that will be shared between all of the projects on your machine. Next, you can create a sub agent manually, but we recommend using Claude Code to automatically generate it for you. Our first sub agent will be a code reviewer. I'll ask Claude to make a sub agent that reviews code quality and security issues. Claude will use your input to generate a name, description, and system prompt for the sub agent.

We'll see those in a moment, but before we do, we get the opportunity to customize the tools that this sub agent has access to. Now, given that our sub agent is only responsible for reviewing code, you might decide to disallow tools for editing, but I'll leave in execution to allow the sub agent to more easily identify pending changes. Next, you'll be prompted to select the model that powers the sub agent. And finally, a color. This color is used in the UI to help you better identify the sub agent, and it also just adds a little bit of personal flair. Now, at the summary window, we see that the sub agent config file will be saved into my current project at this path.

Now, let's open up that file to get a better idea of what's going on. The name field is a unique identifier. This is how you reference the sub agent either by asking Claude directly or using @agentcodereviewer in your message. The description controls when Claude decides to use the sub agent. The description must be on a single line. Notice that there are escaped new line characters in there.

If you want Claude to use the sub agent automatically more often, add in the word proactively to the description. You can also add example conversations to help Claude understand when it should be using the sub agent. The tools field lists which tools the sub agent can access. The list of tools will match the tools we granted access to during the agent generation, but you can further edit the list of tools in this file if you want. The model field specifies which Claude model to use. Sonnet, Opus, Haiku, or inherit.

Use Haiku for fast tasks, Opus for complex analysis, and Sonnet if you need something between the two. Inherit will use the same model as your main conversation. The body of the file contains the system prompt that is given to the sub agent. The system prompt will provide guidance to the sub agent helping it understand how to complete its tasks and how it should return information back to the main agent. Now, for the fun part. After creating your sub agent, test it by making some code changes and asking Claude to review them.

If the sub agent isn't being used when you expect, check your description. Adding more specific examples helps Claude understand when to delegate.
