# Designing effective subagents

Now that you know how to create sub agents, let's look at patterns that lead to effective sub agents. First, let's get a better idea of how some of the data in the sub agent config file is used. Whenever you send a message to the main context window agent, the name and description of each sub agent is included in the system prompt. So, if you want to better control when the main agent launches a sub agent automatically, you should modify the name description. Next, remember that when a sub agent is launched, the main agent writes an input prompt. When writing this input prompt, it uses the description as guidance.

So, if you want to better control when the main agent launches a sub agent automatically, you should modify the name and description. Let's consider our review sub agent again. Right now, when the main agent runs the sub agent, the sub agent is given an input prompt telling it to use get diff to find the current changes. If we wanted the main agent to more reliably tell the sub agent exactly which files to review, we would update the description. You must tell the agent precisely which files you want it to review. Now, if we ask Claude to run the code reviewer agent, we'll see a different input.

You can also influence what the main thread tells a sub agent through the description. So, adding return sources that can be cited to a web search sub agent's description causes the main thread to include that instruction when delegating the task. The most important improvement that you can make is defining an output format in the system prompt. This creates natural stopping points for the sub agent. Without a defined output format, sub agents struggle to decide when enough research has been done and they tend to run much much longer than sub agents that are given an output format. When a sub agent discovers a workaround to some issue like solving a dependency issue or finding that a certain command needs particular flags, these details should appear in the summary.

Otherwise, the main thread has to rediscover the same solutions. Obstacles encountered, any setup issues, workarounds discovered, or environment quirks, commands that needed special flags or configuration, dependencies or imports that cause problems. Explicitly asking for obstacle reporting in the output format surfaces this information. A read-only sub agent using just glob, grep, read cannot accidentally modify files. This constraint clarifies that the sub agent's role and prevents unintended side effects. So, think about what sub agents actually needs to do.

If it's just researching, it only needs to read files, so keep it read-only. That way it can't accidentally modify anything while exploring. A reviewer needs to run get diff to see what changed, so give it bash access, but it still doesn't need to edit files. Only give edit and write to sub agents that should actually change your code like a styling agent applying CSS updates. This also helps clarify what each sub agent is for when you have several of them. So, effective sub agents use structured output, report obstacles, have specific descriptions, and limit tool access.
